                            <P align="justify" class="text">"Lokmanya Nagar"! What an apt name for our society!
    
                            The word Lokmanya itself suggests 'admired and accepted by the people'
    
                            and the word 'Nagar' is suggestive of the idea of a residential society
    
                            or premises. That is "Lokmanya Nagar". It is indeed our privilege that
    
                            the name of our society is associated with the great erstwhile national
    
                            leader and freedom fighter "Lokmanya Tilak". At the time of formation
    
                            of our society, it was the intention of the founding members to
    
                            provide for two-room tenements to middle-class persons from the small
    
                            income groups. </P>
    
                            <P align=justify class="text">The society was registered on 9th December 1946 under
    
                            the then existing Co-operative Societies Act. It was only in 1948 that
    
                            the construction of the buildings was started and the first batch of
    
                            residents came to reside in the society in the year 1949, when four
    
                            buildings were completed. It is interesting to note that the naming of
    
                            the society took place on 19th December, 1953 under the auspices of
    
                            the then Minister Bhausaheb Hire. The last of the buildings being "J"
    
                            building was constructed in 1981. Since its inception, Lokmanya Nagar
    
                            has been a happy witness to many social, religious and cultural
    
                            activities thereby enriching the lives of its residents as well as of
    
                            those living in the neighbourhood.</p>
    
                            <P align=justify class="text">It is rightly said that "The society does not simply
    
                            consist of the buildings with the walls and the roofs thereon. It really
    
                            consists of its residents and the contributions made by them in the
    
                            various spheres of human activities". Our society situated in the commercial
    
                            capital i.e.Mumbai is like an oasis in a desert. As one enters the
    
                            society, one is surrounded by green clustering trees and the buildings
    
                            well planned, with sufficient space in between as well as adequate
    
                            parking lots. The entire atmosphere is full of joy ,love and tranquillity.
    
                            There is such a protective, warm and cozy feeling at the end of the day
    
                            when one comes back tired and exhausted from office and enters the society.
    
                            It is especially in the late evenings and during festivals and functions
    
                            that one sees the real hustle bustle of the society. There cannot be a
    
                            more social and busy platform than our "baks", as we affectionately call
    
                            them! The Lokmanya Nagar society celebrated its 50th anniversary in December,
    
                            1996. We are now in the 65th year. Launching of a Web Site of our own society
    
                            is a direction for forthcoming needs. <b><i>However, one needs to remember that
    
                            this is not the official web site of the society as such and is only a
    
                            product of the efforts of some enthusiastic minds and talented people.</i></b>
    
                            Of course, it is only the support and encouragement from fellow members
    
                            and residents that this web site shall continue to grow leaps and bounds.</p>
    
                            <P align=justify class="text">Today, our society really resembles a big banyan tree
    
                            with its numerous branches spread out in all directions and as far as
    
                            the human eye can reach. So many of our members, their children,
    
                            parents and relatives are settled in different parts of India and all
    
                            over the world. Just like the world has shrunk in size due to the
    
                            advancement in technology and satellite communication, it is time that
    
                            our society comes closer not only in form but also in spirit. Wherever
    
                            we all might be, ultimately we all shall continue to trace our roots
    
                            back to Lokmanya Nagar. It is time that we create a common platform,
    
                            where all of us proud Lokmanyaites can interact, communicate and be in
    
                            touch in a much regular manner. Today, most of us are internet savy,
    
                            have access to the latest technology and all we have to do is to make
    
                            optimum use of our resources all over the world to evolve and nurture
    
                            the ever lasting bond between us. The web site shall not only be a
    
                            common platform for interaction and information sharing but it shall
    
                            be our vehicle for displaying our unity amidst geographical diversity.</p>
    
                            <P align=justify class="text">Wherever we are, UK or USA, Australia or Russia, UAE
    
                            or Canada, let us all resolve to create, nurture and develop this web
    
                            site and its nobles ideals and objectives.</p><br>
