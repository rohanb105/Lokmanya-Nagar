                        <P align="justify" class="text">"Lokmanya Nagar"! What an apt name for our society!

                        The word Lokmanya itself suggests 'admired and accepted by the people'

                        and the word 'Nagar' is suggestive of the idea of a residential society

                        or premises. That is "Lokmanya Nagar". It is indeed our privilege that

                        the name of our society is associated with the great erstwhile national

                        leader and freedom fighter "Lokmanya Tilak". At the time of formation

                        of our society, it was the intention of the founding members to

                        provide for two-room tenements to middle-class persons from the small

                        income groups. </P>

                        <P align=justify class="text">The society was registered on 9th December 1946 under

                        the then existing Co-operative Societies Act. It was only in 1948 that

                        the construction of the buildings was started and the first batch of

                        residents came to reside in the society in the year 1949, when four

                        buildings were completed. It is interesting to note that the naming of

                        the society took place on 19th December, 1953 under the auspices of

                        the then Minister Bhausaheb Hire. The last of the buildings being "J"

                        building was constructed in 1981. Since its inception, Lokmanya Nagar

                        has been a happy witness to many social, religious and cultural

                        activities thereby enriching the lives of its residents as well as of

                        those living in the neighbourhood.</p>

                        <P align=justify class="text">It is rightly said that "The society does not simply

                        consist of the buildings with the walls and the roofs thereon. It really

                        consists of its residents and the contributions made by them in the

                        various spheres of human activities". Our society situated in the commercial

                        capital i.e.Mumbai is like an oasis in a desert. As one enters the

                        society, one is surrounded by green clustering trees and the buildings

                        well planned, with sufficient space in between as well as adequate

                        parking lots. The entire atmosphere is full of joy ,love and tranquillity.

                        There is such a protective, warm and cozy feeling at the end of the day

                        when one comes back tired and exhausted from office and enters the society.

                        It is especially in the late evenings and during festivals and functions

                        that one sees the real hustle bustle of the society. There cannot be a

                        more social and busy platform than our "baks", as we affectionately call

                        them! The Lokmanya Nagar society celebrated its 50th anniversary in December,

                        1996. We are now in the 65th year. Launching of a Web Site of our own society

                        is a direction for forthcoming needs. <b><i>However, one needs to remember that

                        this is not the official web site of the society as such and is only a

                        product of the efforts of some enthusiastic minds and talented people.</i></b>

                        Of course, it is only the support and encouragement from fellow members

                        and residents that this web site shall continue to grow leaps and bounds.</p>

                        <P align=justify class="text">Today, our society really resembles a big banyan tree

                        with its numerous branches spread out in all directions and as far as

                        the human eye can reach. So many of our members, their children,

                        parents and relatives are settled in different parts of India and all

                        over the world. Just like the world has shrunk in size due to the

                        advancement in technology and satellite communication, it is time that

                        our society comes closer not only in form but also in spirit. Wherever

                        we all might be, ultimately we all shall continue to trace our roots

                        back to Lokmanya Nagar. It is time that we create a common platform,

                        where all of us proud Lokmanyaites can interact, communicate and be in

                        touch in a much regular manner. Today, most of us are internet savy,

                        have access to the latest technology and all we have to do is to make

                        optimum use of our resources all over the world to evolve and nurture

                        the ever lasting bond between us. The web site shall not only be a

                        common platform for interaction and information sharing but it shall

                        be our vehicle for displaying our unity amidst geographical diversity.</p>

                        <P align=justify class="text">Wherever we are, UK or USA, Australia or Russia, UAE

                        or Canada, let us all resolve to create, nurture and develop this web

                        site and its nobles ideals and objectives.</p><br>
